In 4604B, there is a wax coating protecting the red and green wire. strip it off carefully using 30 AWG stranded setting on strippers to make incision.
all wires besides ground have string-filler that should be removed before soldering. burning the string filler with a lighter will char the copper, complicating the tinning step of the soldering process.
